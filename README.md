Projects

The database project is in the mini_sql folder. This project is a small version of a relational database management system (DBMS), as well as a DSL (Domain Specific Language) with which a user can interact with the database. The implemented language is very similar to SQL. The implementation of the database is in the db folder.

The cpu project is in my_cpu folder. This cpu is an implementation of a 32-bit two-cycle processor based on RISC-V. cpu.circ in the cpu_tests_pipelined in the final pipelined form of the cpu. 

The classifier project is in the review_classifier_proj folder. I used the MapReduce programming paradigm to parallelize a simple Naive Bayes classifier with a Bag of Words model in Spark to predict Yelp review ratings.
